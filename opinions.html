          I find the law a bit repetitive, since there are already laws <br>
          regarding equal rights rights. But I think it'd be better if it <br>
          was passed because it protects people; not just the lgbt community <br>
          but also those who are discriminated, such as single parents. <br>

          I am in favor of the SOGIE Equality Bill, . . .I think that we <br>
          should aim to properly educate people and discuss this topic <br>
          so that the stigma about it is lessened. We should also be active in fighting <br>
          for its approval because it is very much needed in our society today. <br>

          I think that the sogie bill needs to be passed because this bill <br>
          will basically protect everybody's rights to be who they are. while <br>
          the bill is still imperfect, its general concept, which is to promote <br>
          equality and remind everyone that we all have equal rights, <br>
          is something that i am all for. <br>

          It is something long overdue, considering the fact that most of the <br>
          Filipinos are still conservative and closed-minded with the community.<br>
          With the approval of the said bill, it would help the LGBTQIA+ community <br>
          in establishing a connection with our modern society without being treated differently. <br>

          I believe it's quite flawed in the way that reforms will be applied, <br>
          but overall I appreciate the idea and what they're trying to <br>
          accomplish. I just hope everyone can cooperate to end discrimination. <br>

          In my opinion the SOGIE Bill is important because all humans have <br>
          the right to be respected. However, I wish that it was not needed and <br>
          that respect would be common knowledge. Since it is not, and there are <br>
          humans who violate others rights especially the rights of those who identify <br>
          as a different gender and have a different sexual orientation, the SOGIE Bill <br>
          is an eye-opener and can hopefully reduce the number of cases of discrimination. <br>
